            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> I am a software developer with master's degree in computer science. I have a
                passion for C++ programming and enjoy working on projects with vast structural
                designs and complex algorithms. I am always eager to learn new technologies and
                deepen my knowledge of software development.

                    <p>Implementation of graph support for C++ language.

                        Started as a university project, later developed into a standalone library,
                        offering a number of functionalities such as graph coloring and finding the shortest path.

                        Currently under a major refactor, aiming to improve the code quality and add new features.
