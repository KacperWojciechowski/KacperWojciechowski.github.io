            <p>Hello, my name is Kacper!</p>
            <p>I'm a C++ software enginner, with a Master's degree in Computer Science, graduated from the 
                <a href="https://uz.zgora.pl/" target="_blank">
                    University of Zielona GÃ³ra,
                </a>
                Poland, at the 
                <a href="https://wiea.uz.zgora.pl/" target="_blank">
                    Faculty of Computer, Electrical and Control Engineering.
                </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                My main interrests include programming both in high and low abstraction levels, IoT, 
                general STEM (such as physics, maths, astronomy and so on) and video games.
                I spend my free time playing and coding private projects from time to time.
            </p>
            <p>
                For a couple of years I was an active member of 
                <a href="https://knik.spaceregion.eu/" target="_blank">
                    Space Engineering Science Club
                </a>
                at my university, where I was the team
                leader of the software and electronics teams. The primary project I took part in and overseen the progress of
                was a marsian rover prototype, based on STM microcontrollers. I was responsible for the software architecture, 
                communication design between components, and electrical design of the rover.
                <br>
                My additional activities within the science club included training new members and organizing programming and
                electronics workshops for middle school students during classes in colaboration with 
                <a href="https://cbkpan.pl/" target="_blank">
                    The Space Research Centre of the Polish Academy of Sciences
                </a> 
                (CBK PAN).
