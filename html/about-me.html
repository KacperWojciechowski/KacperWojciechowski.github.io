                Hello, my name is Kacper!<br><br>
                I'm a C++ software enginner, with a Master's degree in Computer Science, graduated from the 
                <a href="https://uz.zgora.pl/" target="_blank">
                    University of Zielona GÃ³ra,
                </a>
                Poland, at the 
                <a href="https://wiea.uz.zgora.pl/" target="_blank">
                    Faculty of Computer, Electrical and Control Engineering.</a>
                <br><br>
                My main interrests include programming both in high and low abstraction levels, IoT, 
                general STEM (such as physics, maths, astronomy and so on) and video games.
                For a couple of years I was an active member of 
                <a href="https://knik.spaceregion.eu/" target="_blank">
                    Space Engineering Science Club
                </a>
                at my university, where I was the team
                leader of the software and electronics teams. The primary project I took part in and overseen the progress of
                was a marsian rover prototype, based on STM microcontrollers. I was responsible for the software architecture, 
                communication design between components, and electrical design of the rover.
                My additional activities within the science club included training new members and organizing programming and
                electronics workshops for middle school students during classes in colaboration with 
                <a href="https://cbkpan.pl/" target="_blank">
                    The Space Research Centre of the Polish Academy of Sciences
                </a> 
                (CBK PAN).
